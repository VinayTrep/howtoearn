                <span class="element_style">To give the affiliates a motivation to earn more quickly we use a 3*3 matrix
                    compensation plan.</span>
                <p> Another powerful feature of our compensation plan is that you get a 200% sponsor’s commission for
                    all
                    the members that you personally sponsor and 300% sponsors match commission for the non-sponsored
                    members. Which helps you earn quickly.</p>
